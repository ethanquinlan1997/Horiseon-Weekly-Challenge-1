## Description

This project was to refractor an already exisiting code. The starter code to this site had a lot errors from improper use of html semantics to dry code. This caused the backend side of things to look a bit hectic. My job was to ensure that I could clean up as much of the mistakes as I could. I made sure that all html semantics were used properply and in working order. I also consolidated a few selectors in the css to give a cleaner look. From this project, I learned how to refractor existing code to ensure a more accessible site for everyone.
